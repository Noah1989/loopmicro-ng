The matrix has a place for every bit of 64 bytes, where a diode can either be
placed (1) or not placed (0), represented by dots in the illustration. LEDs are
used instead of regular diodes so that the bytes light up when accessed by the
CPU. The numbers on the left are the memory adresses and the text in the middle
is a cheat sheet for converting hexadecimal codes to binary.

A major milestone will be to place a program into these few bytes that allows us
to read and write arbitrary memory locations through the 7 segment display and
push buttons on the main board. Such a program is called a machine code monitor.
It allows us to write much larger programs that do not fit into the small diode
matrix. But before we do that, we make simpler programs to understand all the
necessary parts individually. These are the topics that we will go through:

	• CPU control instructions, jumps and loops					
	• Memory, the stack and subroutines						
	• Input and output								
	• Arithmetic and lookup tables
