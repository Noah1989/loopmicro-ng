A major milestone will be to place a program into these 64 bytes that allows us
to read and write arbitrary memory locations through the 7 segment display and
push buttons on the main board.  Such a program is called a machine code
monitor.  It allows us to write much larger programs that do not fit into the 64
bytes of the diode matrix.  But before we do that, we make simpler programs to
understand all the necessary parts individually.  These are the topics that we
will go through:

  • CPU control instructions, jumps and loops					
  • Memory, the stack and subroutines						
  • Input and output								
  • Arithmetic and lookup tables
