The computer is designed so that it can be constructed from off-the-shelf parts
(except for the printed circuit board) and immediately be used. To do so, we
need a way to tell the computer what to do. This is called programming and is
nowadays almost always done by using a collection of existing programs on the
computerq to be programmed itself or on other computers. Our computer is still
completly ignorant of any programming and we don't want to use other computers.
Therefore we devise our programs on paper and feed the binary code directly into
the machine.

Even entering a binary program into the computer is a tedious process when there
is no help from the CPU. Traditionally this is done using a device called "front
panel" which is a series of buttons, lamps and switches that are directly
connected to the computer's bus. This way the program can be punched bit by bit
into main memory. There are two downsides to this, though: firstly, this
introduces a lot of mechanical parts whose only purpose is to enter a progam
that makes them obsolete as soon as possible, and secondly the the entered
program can easily be accidentally overwritten by a rogue program, and will be
lost when the computer is turned off. This can get frustrating very quickly
because the same bytes need to be fed to the machine over and over again.
Therefore another approach is described here. Constructing and using a front
panel through the expansion port is certainly possible however, and is left as
an exercise to the reader.

The method in this book uses a diode matrix ROM as seen on the next page.
